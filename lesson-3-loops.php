 * Loops and lists
 * ---------------------------------
 * Often in programming we want to perform the same repetitive action many times
 * and only stop we certain conditions are met. We do this using a loop. We can 
 * often make use of loops to peform the same action on lists, but we'll get into
 * that later.

 * Often in programming we want to store a information in a list, such as a list 
 * names. This has a few benefits, first we can put all the information in one
 * variable (instead of one for each name), we can then move the whole list about
 * or code together and we can perform the same action of every item in the list
 * we then use loops to carry out this action.
